<p>The monad of the day is <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>.

<p>In terms of model specification, what we have for contentious terms is basically a case definition:
<pre>
phosphorus "John" = "Morning Star"
phosphorus _ = "Venus"
</pre>
Here we are saying that if the perspective used to interpret the name Phosphorus is John's then the interpretation is <code>"Morning Star"</code>, then we use underscore <code>_</code> to capture all other perspectives. Of course we could have a more varied definition:
<pre>
phosphorus "John" = "Morning Star"
phosphorus "Tom" = "Little green men planet"
phosphorus _ = "Venus"
</pre></p>
