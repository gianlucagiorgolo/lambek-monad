<p>The monad of today is <code>&lt;ci&gt;</code></p> with its two natural transformations <code>unit_ci</code> and <code>bind_ci</code>. As you probably have noticed, we wrote <code>bind_ci</code> in infix notation, so that it looks more like the star we use in the lectures. To do that we have simply surrounded it with backticks <code>``</code>.</p>

<p>The only other magic here is the function <code>write</code>, which behaves exactly like the function we discussed in the lecture.</p>
