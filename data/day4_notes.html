<p>Today we have two monads: <code>&lt;pr&gt;</code> for probability and <code>&lt;lh&gt;</code> for the simple likelihood semiring.</p>

<p>In specifying the model we are using a bunch of predefined functions. First of all we have <code>Probability</code> and <code>Likelihood</code> to specify "distributions". Distributions are really just lists (comma separated elements in between square brackets <code>[a,b,c]</code>) of pairs (two comma separated things in between parentheses <code>(a,b)</code>) of string-values and either a probability or an element of the semiring. To get probabilities we have some functions that were trained to predict the outcome of football national teams matches. As expected <code>predictVictory</code>, <code>predictDraw</code>, <code>predictLoss</code> return respectively the probability of the first team winning, drawing or losing against the second team. Finally we have a convenience function <code>toSimpleSemiring</code> that converts a probability into an element of the semiring.</p>
